## üöÄ Getting Started

If you're new to Linux, start with the [Getting Started](01-getting-started.md) guide and work your way through each section in order. Each section builds upon the previous ones, gradually increasing in complexity.

## üí° How to Use This Guide

- **Complete Beginners**: Follow the sections in order, practicing commands as you go
- **Intermediate Users**: Jump to specific sections that interest you
- **Reference**: Use this as a quick reference guide when you need to remember a command
- **DevOps Focus**: Pay special attention to the Networking, Process Management, and Useful Tips sections

## üéØ Prerequisites

- Access to a Linux system (physical machine, virtual machine, or WSL on Windows)
- Basic computer literacy
- Willingness to learn and experiment

## üõ†Ô∏è Practice Environment

You can practice Linux commands in several ways:
- **Virtual Machine**: Use VirtualBox or VMware with Ubuntu
- **WSL**: Windows Subsystem for Linux (for Windows users)
- **Cloud**: Free tier on AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean
- **Docker**: Run Linux containers
- **Online**: Try Linux in your browser at [JSLinux](https://bellard.org/jslinux/)

## üìñ Learning Tips

1. **Practice regularly**: The only way to master Linux is by using it
2. **Don't memorize**: Understand concepts, use man pages for syntax
3. **Break things**: Use VMs or containers to safely experiment
4. **Read error messages**: They usually tell you what's wrong
5. **Use tab completion**: Save time and avoid typos
6. **Check command history**: Learn from your past commands
7. **Start simple**: Master basics before diving into complex topics
